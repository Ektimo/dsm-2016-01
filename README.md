# Data Science Slovenia meetup - January 2016

Here you will find a presented jupyter notebooks:
- **Short presentation** includes some remarks about jupyter notebooks and some extensions.
- **DataScienceMeetup_talk_py** includes custom weighted random forest model. However, if you would like to test the code, you comment: **feature_weighting** import sentence and all usage of **weights** to obtain normal scikit-learn random forest classifier. Unfortunately custom random forest model runs only on python 2.7.
- **DataScienceMeetup_talk_r** includes R code for random forest classifier that predicts future bank deposits.

The dataset was taken from [Machine Learning Repository](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) - it is the older dataset.
